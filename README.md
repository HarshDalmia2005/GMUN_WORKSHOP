# MedChain - Blockchain-Based Medical Records System

MedChain is a simple and secure medical records management system that uses blockchain technology to store patient prescriptions. It allows patients to book appointments and view their medical records, while doctors can manage appointments and write prescriptions that are permanently stored on the blockchain.

## What Does This App Do?

Think of MedChain as a digital medical records system where:
- **Patients** can book appointments with doctors and view their medical prescriptions
- **Doctors** can see their appointments and write prescriptions for patients
- **Blockchain** ensures that all medical records are secure, permanent, and cannot be changed or deleted

## Architecture

This is a **frontend-only application** built with React that connects to the Ethereum blockchain. Here's how it works:

```
User Interface (React App)
        ↓
Wallet Connection (MetaMask)
        ↓
Blockchain Service (ethers.js)
        ↓
Smart Contract (Ethereum)
```

### Key Technologies:
- **React** - JavaScript library for building the user interface
- **Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **ethers.js** - Library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
- **TailwindCSS** - Styling framework for beautiful designs
- **Lucide React** - Icons for the interface

## Folder Structure

Here's what each folder and file does:

## How Each Part Works

### 1. **Entry Point (`main.jsx`)**
This is where the app starts. It renders the App component and wraps it with Toast and Wallet providers.

### 2. **Main App (`App.jsx`)**
- Controls which screen to show (role selection, patient view, or doctor view)
- Acts like a traffic controller for the whole application

### 3. **Components Folder**
Think of components as building blocks:

- **RoleSelection.jsx** - The first screen where you choose to login as Patient or Doctor
- **BlockchainConnect.jsx** - The "Connect Wallet" button that links your MetaMask
- **WalletContext.jsx** - Keeps track of whether your wallet is connected
- **ToastContext.jsx** - Shows pop-up messages (like "Prescription saved!")

### 4. **Doctor Components**
These are only for doctors:
- View all their appointments
- See patient details
- Write and save prescriptions to the blockchain

### 5. **Patient Components**
These are only for patients:
- Book new appointments with doctors
- View their upcoming appointments
- See all their prescriptions from the blockchain

### 6. **Config Folder**
Contains settings like:
- Which blockchain network to use
- The smart contract address
- Other configuration details

### 7. **Contracts Folder**
Contains the Solidity smart contract (`MedicalRecordsStorage.sol`) that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract has functions to:
- Store new prescriptions
- Retrieve prescriptions for a patient
- Ensure only doctors can write prescriptions

### 8. **Services Folder**
The `blockchainService.js` file contains all the functions that:
- Connect to the blockchain
- Save data to the smart contract
- Read data from the smart contract
- Handle errors and transactions

## Using MedChain as a **Doctor**

### Managing Your Appointments

1. Click on the **"Appointments"** tab
2. You'll see all appointments scheduled with you
3. For each appointment, you can see:
   - Patient information
   - Appointment date and time
   - Reason for visit
   - Appointment status
4. Update appointment status as needed (Pending → Confirmed → Completed)

### Writing Prescriptions

1. Go to the **"Prescriptions"** tab
2. Click **"Write New Prescription"** button
3. Fill in the prescription form:
   - **Patient Address** - Enter the patient's blockchain wallet address
   - **Medications** - List all medications (name, dosage, frequency)
   - **Diagnosis** - Write the medical diagnosis
   - **Special Instructions** - Add any special notes or warnings
4. Click **"Save to Blockchain"** to submit
5. MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction
6. Pay the gas fee to complete the transaction
7. Wait for blockchain confirmation (usually takes a few seconds)
8. You'll see a success message once the prescription is saved

### Viewing Patient Prescriptions

1. In the **"Prescriptions"** tab
2. Enter a patient's wallet address in the search box
3. You'll see all prescriptions you've written for that patient
4. You can review previous prescriptions before writing new ones

## Important Notes

- **Blockchain Transactions**: When you write a prescription, you need to pay a small gas fee in cryptocurrency (usually ETH)
- **Permanent Records**: Once a prescription is saved to the blockchain, it cannot be edited or deleted
- **Wallet Security**: Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone
- **Test Network**: Make sure you're connected to the correct blockchain network (test or mainnet)

## Project Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality

## Built With Love 

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used for secure medical records management. It's built with modern web technologies and designed to be simple yet powerful.
